# Notes

This script replaces some words on webpages with others for humorous effect.

Complete rewrite of "Replace Text On Webpages" by JoeSimmons.

See: http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/review/41369 

There are two lines that are borrowed, the rest have been completely rewritten.
I really hope JoeSimmons doesn't mind me borrowing two lines - I've actually tried to track down somewhere I can contact them (found a profile on github, but github doesn't allow messaging, userscripts is dead).

Improvements over original implementation:
* Use native regex format - easier to write catch-all replacements.
* Simplified code, easier to understand and variable names make sense.
* Replacements are a list rather than dictionary - guaranteed order.

This work is public domain because I really don't care about what license a js files for replacing words on webpages should go under.
